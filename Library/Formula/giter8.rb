  # note: because sbt-launch dynamically downloads giter8 from the maven repos

  #   is installed, the above url and sha256 are related to sbt-launch.jar.
  #   The version below is that of giter8, and when upgrading this formula,
  #   one must check the giter8 version is available in maven repositories.

    Giter8 will download the Scala runtime and the rest of the
    giter8 binaries the first time you run it.
    You can do that now by running "g8".

    If the download of a resources fails, try cleaning your
    ~/.ivy2/cache folder and rerun / reinstall giter8.
