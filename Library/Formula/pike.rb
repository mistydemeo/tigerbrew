    # installation is complicated by some of brew's standard patterns.
    # hopefully these notes explain the reasons for diverging from
    # the path that most other formulae use.
    #
    # item 1
    #
    # basically, pike already installs itself naturally as brew would want
    # it; that is, if prefix=/Cellar, installation would create
    # /Cellar/pike/ver/bin and so forth. We could just go with that, but it's
    # possible that homebrew might change its layout and then the formula
    # would no longer work.
    #
    # so, rather than guessing at it, we do this alternate gyration, forcing
    # pike to install in a slightly nonstandard way (for pike, at least)
    #
    # item 2
    #
    # a second problem crops up because the during installation, the link
    # function tries to pull in stuff from lib/, which is really more like
    # what one would expect share or libexec in homebrew might be: pike
    # specific files, rather than shared libraries. we could approach this
    # in a similar fashion, but the result would be a really odd arrangement
    # for anyone remotely familar with standard pike installs.
    #
    # because there's no way to override the keg.link command, this formula
    # installs the whole pike install into prefix/libexec and then links the
    # man page and binary back into prefix/share and prefix/bin. not so
    # elegant, but that's the way brew works.
