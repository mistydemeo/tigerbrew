# Note: Mutt has a large number of non-upstream patches available for
# it, some of which conflict with each other. These patches are also
# not kept up-to-date when new versions of mutt (occasionally) come
# out.
#
# To reduce Homebrew's maintenance burden, new patches are not being
# accepted for this formula. We would be very happy to see members of
# the mutt community maintain a more comprehesive tap with better
# support for patches.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      mutt_dotlock(1) has been installed, but does not have the permissions to lock
      spool files in /var/mail. To grant the necessary permissions, run

        sudo chgrp mail #{bin}/mutt_dotlock
        sudo chmod g+s #{bin}/mutt_dotlock

      Alternatively, you may configure `spoolfile` in your .muttrc to a file inside
      your home directory.
