  def caveats; <<-EOS.undent
    To use the zpython module in zsh you need to
    add the following line to your .zshrc:

      module_path=($module_path #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/lib/zpython)

    If you want to use this with powerline, make sure you set
    it early in .zshrc, before your prompt gets initialized.

    After reloading your shell you can test with:
      zmodload zsh/zpython && zpython 'print "hello world"'
    EOS
  end
