  def caveats; <<-EOS.undent
    This formula does not install runit as a replacement for init.
    The service directory is #{var}/service instead of /service.

    To have runit ready to run services, start runsvdir:
         runsvdir -P #{var}/service

    Depending on the services managed by runit, this may need to start as root.
