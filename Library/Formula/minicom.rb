Terminal Compatibility
======================
If minicom doesn't see the LANG variable, it will try to fallback to
make the layout more compatible, but uglier. Certain unsupported
encodings will completely render the UI useless, so if the UI looks
strange, try setting the following environment variable:

LANG="en_US.UTF-8"

Text Input Not Working
======================
Most development boards require Serial port setup -> Hardware Flow
Control to be set to "No" to input text.
