    The home of JBoss Application Server 7 is:
      #{opt_libexec}

    You may want to add the following to your .bash_profile:
      export JBOSS_HOME=#{opt_libexec}
      export PATH=${PATH}:${JBOSS_HOME}/bin

    Note: The support scripts used by JBoss Application Server 7 have
    very generic names. These are likely to conflict with support scripts
    used by other Java-based server software. Hence they are *NOT* linked
    to bin.
