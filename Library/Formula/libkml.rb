    # Correct an issue where internal third-party libs (libminizip and liburiparser)
    # are installed as dylibs. liburiparser conflicts with uriparser formula.
    # libminizip conflicts with new formula, and some of its symbols have been
    # renamed with prefixes of "libkml_", i.e, can't be linked against for other builds
    # Fix just forces internal libs to be linked statically until the following
    # is addressed upstream: https://code.google.com/p/libkml/issues/detail?id=50
