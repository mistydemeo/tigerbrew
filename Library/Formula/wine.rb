        The current version of Wine contains a partial implementation of dwrite.dll
        which may cause text rendering issues in applications such as Steam.
        We recommend that you run winecfg, add an override for dwrite in the
        Libraries tab, and edit the override mode to "disable". See:
          https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31374

        By default Wine uses a native Mac driver. To switch to the X11 driver, use
        regedit to set the "graphics" key under "HKCU\Software\Wine\Drivers" to
        "x11" (or use winetricks).

        For best results with X11, install the latest version of XQuartz:
