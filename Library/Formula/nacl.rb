    # NaCL has an odd compilation model (software by djb, who'da thunk it?)
    # and installs the resulting binaries in a directory like:
    #    <nacl source>/build/<hostname>/lib/<arch>/libnacl.a
    #    <nacl source>/build/<hostname>/include/<arch>/crypto_box.h
    # etc. Each of these is optimized for the specific hardware it's
    # compiled on.
    #
    # It also builds both x86 and x86_64 copies if your compiler can
    # handle it. Here we only install one copy, based on if you're a
    # 64bit system or not. A --universal could come later though I guess.
