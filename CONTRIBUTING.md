Tigerbrew guidelines
--------------------

* Check [the wiki](https://github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew/wiki/Tigerbrew-features) for information on Tigerbrew-specific features, like determining PPC CPU type.

* Don't break Intel builds when contributing PPC fixes. We support Intel Tiger, and in general try to avoid breaking anything that works in Homebrew.

* Try to avoid breaking builds on newer OSs when you submit fixes for Tiger and Intel.
